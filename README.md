# hello-world
My first steps in GitHub, a robot is my guide :).
I'm an almost 40 year old guy that tries to learn how to code (and eventualy find some job in that area). 
For almost 20 years I was a professional musician, playing double bass and bass guitar all over the Europe.
Since March, when COVID hits my country, I'm generally speaking unemployed - there are no live gigs allowed. 
Started with Python and I'm loving it.
